## Getters

### Client

Statebag: Entity(vehicleId).state.fuel

```lua
local vehicle = cache.vehicle -- Ox Lib example
local fuel = Entity(vehicle).state.fuel

-- Optimized statebags method (not recommended in loops)
lib.onCache('vehicle', function(vehicle)
    if not vehicle then
        return
    end

    local state = Entity(cache.vehicle).state
    print(state.fuel)
end)

-- Best way
lib.onCache('vehicle', function(vehicle)
    if not vehicle then
        return
    end

    SetTimeout(0, function()
        while cache.vehicle do
            print(GetVehicleFuelLevel(cache.vehicle))
            Wait(100)
        end
    end)
end)
```

Export: exports\['Renewed-Fuel']:GetFuel(vehicleId) -- (Not recommended)

```lua
local fuel, fuelType = exports['Renewed-Fuel']:GetFuel(cache.vehicle) -- ox lib example
```

```lua
local fuel = GetVehicleFuelLevel(vehicle) -- Recommended for huds etc.
```

#### isElectric

Useful to check if the vehicle is an electric car without storing additional useless information in other resoruce

```lua
local isElectric = exports['Renewed-Fuel']:isElectric(cache.vehicle)
```

### Server

Statebag: Entity(vehicleId).state.fuel

```lua
local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(GetPlayerPed(source))
local fuel = Entity(vehicle).state.fuel
local fuelType = Entity(vehicle).state.fuelType
```

## Setters

### Client

Export: exports\['Renewed-Fuel']:SetFuel(vehicleId)

```lua
exports['Renewed-Fuel']:SetFuel(cache.vehicle, amount, fuelType) 
-- fueltype defaults to current fuelType or 86 if nil
```

### &#x20;Server

Export: exports\['Renewed-Fuel']:SetFuel(vehicleId)

```lua
local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(GetPlayerPed(source))
exports['Renewed-Fuel']:SetFuel(vehicle, amount, fuelType) 
```



### Gas Station exports

Get the gas station tank storage

```lua
local Storage = exports['Renewed-Fuel']:GetStorage(StationId, tankId) 
-- Station ID is the ID in the db, the tankId, is 1-4 depending on how many tanks the station have 
```

Set the gas station tank storage

```lua
exports['Renewed-Fuel']:SetStorage(StationId, tankId, amount, fuelType)
-- Station ID is the ID in the db, tankId is 1-4 depending how many tanks the station have
```
